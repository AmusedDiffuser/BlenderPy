# BlenderPyB Depth Map Script
(NOTE:UNTESTED AI GENERATED CODE AS OF POSTING)

This is a Python script for Blender that imports a depth map image as a plane and applies displacement and adaptive subdivision to create a 3D surface.

## Installation

To install the script, you need to have Blender 3.5 or higher installed on your system. You can download Blender from [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).

To run the script, you can either:

- Copy and paste the code into the text editor in Blender and click `Run Script`.
- Save the code as a `.py` file and open it in Blender's text editor and click `Run Script`.
- Save the code as a `.py` file and run it from the command line with `blender --python <file_name>.py`.

## Usage

The script will prompt you to enter the file name of the depth map image, the scale value for the displacement and the dicing rate for the adaptive subdivision. You can either enter your own values or press `Enter` to use the default values.

The script will then import the image as a plane and apply the necessary settings and modifiers to create a 3D surface. You can view the result in the 3D viewport or render it with Cycles.

## Use Cases

Some possible use cases for this script are:

- Creating realistic terrains from satellite images or digital elevation models.
- Creating 3D portraits from depth-sensing cameras or photogrammetry software.
- Creating 3D models from hand-drawn sketches or paintings.
- Creating 3D animations from video frames or motion capture data.
- Creating 3D sculptures from clay models or 3D scans.
