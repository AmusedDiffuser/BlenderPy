# BlenderPy Depth Map Script

(NOTE:UNTESTED AI GENERATED CODE AS OF POSTING)


This is a Python script for Blender that imports a depth map image as a plane and applies displacement and adaptive subdivision to create a 3D surface.

## Installation

To install the script, you need to have Blender 3.5 or higher installed on your system. You can download Blender from [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).

To run the script, you can either:

- Copy and paste the code into the text editor in Blender and click `Run Script`.

- Save the code as a `.py` file and open it in Blender's text editor and click `Run Script`.

- Save the code as a `.py` file and run it from the command line with `blender --python <file_name>.py`.


Some examples of running the script from the command line are:

- To run the script with the default values and a file named `depth_map.png` in the same folder as the script, you can use this command:

  `blender --python depth_map_script.py depth_map.png`

- To run the script with a different file name and custom values for the scale and dicing rate, you can use this command:

  `blender --python depth_map_script.py -- <file_name> <scale_value> <dicing_rate>`

  For example, to run the script with a file named `terrain.png`, a scale value of 0.2 and a dicing rate of 0.5, you can use this command:

  `blender --python depth_map_script.py -- terrain.png 0.2 0.5`

## Usage

The script will prompt you to enter the file name of the depth map image, the scale value for the displacement and the dicing rate for the adaptive subdivision. You can either enter your own values or press `Enter` to use the default values.

The script will then import the image as a plane and apply the necessary settings and modifiers to create a 3D surface.

## Use Cases

Some possible use cases for this script are:

- Creating realistic terrains from satellite images or digital elevation models.

- Creating 3D portraits from depth-sensing cameras or photogrammetry software.

- Creating 3D models from hand-drawn sketches or paintings.

- Creating 3D animations from video frames or motion capture data.

- Creating 3D sculptures from clay models or 3D scans.
